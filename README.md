# TabletopBuddy

Tabletop Buddy is an Android app that allows users to search for tabletop games, add games to a library and randomly pick a game from their library. Tabletop Buddy uses the official <a href ="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi2"> BoardGameGeek API</a> for game data. A <a href ="https://github.com/marcioos/bgg-client">BGG Client </a>is used to query the API.

Tabletop Buddy is designed with Android Studio.
